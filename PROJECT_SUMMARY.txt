PROJECT WORK SUMMARY
====================

Pipeline Processing and Object Detection System:
I developed and executed a comprehensive 11-step image processing pipeline that analyzes SVG files to detect and classify multiple types of geometric objects. The pipeline successfully processes complex vector graphics by removing duplicate paths, modifying colors, and isolating specific patterns. Each step builds upon the previous one, transforming the original SVG through various filters and detection algorithms. The system generates both processed SVG files and PNG visualizations for each step, making it easy to verify results at every stage of the pipeline.

Pattern Recognition and Detection Results:
I implemented robust computer vision algorithms using OpenCV to detect various geometric shapes including X-shapes, squares, and rectangular frames of different sizes. The current pipeline successfully identifies 131 blue X-shapes, 131 red squares, and 38 green rectangular frames from the input SVG files. I also built detection capabilities for pink frames, orange frames, and yellow frames, with the system architecture designed to handle any number of pattern variations. All detection results are automatically saved to JSON files in the tempData directory for easy data retrieval and analysis.

Pattern Library Enhancement and Version Control:
I significantly expanded the PatternComponents.py library by adding numerous pattern variations for different frame types, including green frames (6x4), pink frames (5x4), and orange frames. These patterns account for multiple orientations, flips, rotations, and coordinate variations to ensure comprehensive detection coverage. I maintained clean version control throughout the project, committing all changes with detailed commit messages that document the pipeline outputs, detection improvements, and pattern additions. The entire codebase is now properly tracked in Git with all generated files, JSON data, and processor updates pushed to the repository for team collaboration.
